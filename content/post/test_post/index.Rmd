```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Here we're assuming a simple design. 
# Survey requires the creation of a design object and then has functions that work with that object.
# You can get more complicated, which is when the survey package would be most useful.
svy_df <- svydesign(ids = ~ 1, weights = ~PERWT, data = df2018)

# Taking the mean and standard error from our design object
hint_tbl <- svymean(~hspd_num, design = svy_df)

hint_tbl <- as_tibble(hint_tbl)
names(hint_tbl) <- c("mean", "sd") #The names weren't coerced correctly when transforming into a tibble.
