Getting the Data
================

The easiest way to get census microdata is through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) hosted by the University of Minnesota. While you can get the data directly from the Census Bureau, IPUMS has made it much easier to compare across multiple years and to select the variables you want. IPUMS also provides a codebook that is easy to refer to and notes any important changes from year to year.

I've put the data for just Kentucky up on GitHub, so I'll read it in from there.

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span class='nf'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html'>library</a></span>(<span class='k'><a href='http://tidyverse.tidyverse.org'>tidyverse</a></span>) 
<span class='nf'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html'>library</a></span>(<span class='k'><a href='http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/'>survey</a></span>)

</code></pre>

Cleaning the Data
=================

When downloading the data it's all numeric, even for variables that are categorial - they've been coded and our first step in the analysis will be using the code book to translate them. I won't show all the codebooks, but for this first variable let's take a look at what IPUMS has to say. For all years NA is coded as 00 and No high speed internet is coded as 20. Prior to 2016 there are detailed codes for the type of internet access, while for 2016 and after the code is collapsed.
