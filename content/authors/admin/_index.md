I am an amateur philosopher with an interest in poverty and inequality research. I work as a Data Science Manager at Brown-Forman. I also teach a class in AI and Ethics at the University of Louisville, and a class in the public policy process at the University of Kentucky. In my spare time I like biking, hiking, and reading.
